<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
	Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. 
	These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

<h2>Description:</h2>
	A solution to this problem will be attempted using Python programming language, and its data science stack (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn).
	The trained model will be exported an external file using joblib API.
	The solution process is as follows:

	1. Objective Definition
	2. Data Gathering
	3. Data Preparation
	4. Data Exploration
	5. Model Building
	6. Model Evaluation  
	7. Predictions 

	This project demonstrates my proficiency in Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning programming.
